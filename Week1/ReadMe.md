Graphical user interface, or GUI, is a type of user interface that allows a user to interact with an electronic device using visual elements such as symbols, buttons, menus and windows. 
This allows a user to click on something instead of enter a complex command. GUIs are designed to be user-friendly and engaging. Common line interface, or CLI, is a text-based interface
that allows one to input commands to interact with a computer system. It requires technical knowledge and know the exact syntax for their commands. Although it is complex it offers a 
wide range of control and flexibility. For this reason it is often preferred by advanced users who need to automate specific tasks. GUI tends to be more user friends while CLI gives 
suers more control over the system. For advanced users, CLI is often faster. CLI is generally harder to learn than GUI.
